# Backend Live Transcript Implementation - Summary

## âœ… Changes Made

I've successfully added live transcript support to your existing backend at:
`../Excotel/outbound/bot_browser.py`

## What Was Added

### 1. **User Transcript Forwarding** (Lines 524-561)

When users speak, the backend now sends:

```json
// When user starts speaking
{
  "type": "user_speaking",
  "is_speaking": true
}

// During speech (interim transcript from Deepgram)
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "role": "user",
  "text": "I want to book a...",
  "is_final": false,
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123
}

// When user finishes speaking (final transcript)
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "role": "user",
  "text": "I want to book a demo",
  "is_final": true,
  "timestamp": 1234567890.456
}

{
  "type": "user_speaking",
  "is_speaking": false
}
```

### 2. **Agent Transcript Forwarding** (Lines 569-607)

When AI agent responds, the backend now sends:

```json
// When agent starts speaking (TTS begins)
{
  "type": "agent_speaking",
  "is_speaking": true
}

// Agent's response text (sent to frontend)
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "role": "agent",
  "text": "I'd be happy to help you book a demo!",
  "is_final": true,
  "timestamp": 1234567890.789
}

// When agent finishes speaking (TTS ends)
{
  "type": "agent_speaking",
  "is_speaking": false
}
```

## How It Works

### User Transcript Flow
1. **UserStartedSpeakingFrame** detected by VAD â†’ Send `user_speaking: true`
2. **TranscriptionFrame** received from Deepgram â†’ Send user transcript (interim or final)
3. **Final transcript** received â†’ Send `user_speaking: false`

### Agent Transcript Flow
1. **TextFrame** sent to TTS â†’ Send agent transcript
2. **TTSStartedFrame** â†’ Send `agent_speaking: true`
3. **TTSStoppedFrame** â†’ Send `agent_speaking: false`

## Frontend Integration

Your frontend (`VoiceBooking.tsx`) is **already configured** to receive these messages!

The WebSocket handler (lines 201-243) will automatically:
- âœ… Display user transcripts in blue bubbles
- âœ… Display agent transcripts in gray bubbles
- âœ… Show "You're speaking" indicator
- âœ… Show "AI speaking" indicator
- âœ… Show typing indicators for interim messages

## Testing

### 1. Deploy Your Backend
```bash
cd ../Excotel/outbound
# Deploy to Google Cloud Run (your existing deployment)
```

### 2. Update Frontend API URL
The frontend is already configured to use:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1';
```

Make sure your `.env` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://exotel-telephony-bot-762279639608.asia-south1.run.app
```

### 3. Test the Live Transcript
1. Open your website
2. Click "Book a demo" â†’ "Talk to AI"
3. Start the call
4. Speak: "I want to book a demo"
5. **You should now see:**
   - Your speech appear as blue bubbles (user)
   - AI responses appear as gray bubbles (agent)
   - Speaking indicators during conversation
   - Interim text while speaking (typing...)

## Debug Logs

The backend now includes debug logs for transcript events:

```
[TRANSCRIPT] User started speaking
[TRANSCRIPT] User: [INTERIM] 'I want to book...'
[TRANSCRIPT] User: [FINAL] 'I want to book a demo'
[TRANSCRIPT] User stopped speaking
[TRANSCRIPT] Agent: [FINAL] 'I'd be happy to help you book a demo!'
[TRANSCRIPT] Agent started speaking
[TRANSCRIPT] Agent stopped speaking
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified File
- `../Excotel/outbound/bot_browser.py`

### Lines Modified
- **Lines 524-561**: Added user transcript forwarding in `on_frame_received` handler
- **Lines 569-607**: Added agent transcript forwarding in `on_frame_sent` handler

### No Breaking Changes
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… Audio recording still works
- âœ… LLM function calling still works
- âœ… TTS still works
- âœ… Only added new WebSocket messages

## Architecture

```
User speaks
    â†“
Deepgram STT (TranscriptionFrame)
    â†“
WebSocket â†’ Frontend (user transcript)
    â†“
OpenAI LLM (TextFrame)
    â†“
WebSocket â†’ Frontend (agent transcript)
    â†“
ElevenLabs TTS (TTSStartedFrame/TTSStoppedFrame)
    â†“
WebSocket â†’ Frontend (speaking indicators)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the backend** with these changes
2. **Test the integration** with your frontend
3. **Monitor the logs** to see transcript messages being sent

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see transcripts:

1. **Check backend logs** for `[TRANSCRIPT]` messages
2. **Check browser console** for WebSocket messages
3. **Verify WebSocket connection** is established
4. **Check API URL** in frontend `.env`

### If only user transcripts show (no agent):

- The agent transcripts are sent when `TextFrame` is detected
- Make sure the LLM is generating responses
- Check logs for `[TRANSCRIPT] Agent:` messages

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The changes use your existing:
- âœ… Deepgram STT (already configured)
- âœ… OpenAI LLM (already configured)
- âœ… ElevenLabs/Cartesia TTS (already configured)
- âœ… WebSocket transport (already working)

Just deploy and test! ðŸš€
