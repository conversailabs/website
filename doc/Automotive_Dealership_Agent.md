A: Yes! We offer extended warranty packages up to 7 years or 100,000 miles. You can purchase it anytime before your factory warranty expires.

**Q: What if I have an issue during a road trip?**
A: We provide 24/7 roadside assistance for 3 years. Call our helpline at 1-800-555-HELP, and we'll arrange towing to the nearest AutoDrive service center or authorized repair shop.

**Q: Is insurance mandatory?**
A: Yes, vehicle insurance is mandatory for registration. We can help you get quotes from our insurance partners if needed.

**Q: What's the difference between comprehensive and third-party insurance?**
A: Third-party insurance covers damages to other vehicles and people. Comprehensive insurance covers your vehicle damages as well, including theft, fire, and natural disasters. I recommend comprehensive coverage for new vehicles.

### Delivery & Registration

**Q: Can you deliver my car to another state?**
A: Yes, we can arrange interstate delivery for an additional fee based on distance. Registration will be done in your state. Please allow extra time for this process.

**Q: What if I don't like the car after delivery?**
A: We have a 7-day return policy. If you're not satisfied, you can return the vehicle with no questions asked, provided it's in original condition with less than 100 miles added.

**Q: How do I track my vehicle after booking?**
A: You'll receive regular updates via SMS and email. You can also log in to your account on our website to track real-time status.

A: Yes, all our vehicles come with a complimentary FastTag preloaded with $20.

### Trade-In & Exchange

**Q: Can I trade in a vehicle that's not AutoDrive?**
A: Absolutely! We accept all makes and models for trade-in. Bring your vehicle for a free evaluation.

**Q: What if my trade-in vehicle has a loan?**
A: No problem! We can handle the loan transfer. The outstanding loan amount will be adjusted in the deal, and we'll coordinate with your lender.

**Q: Do I need to repair my old car before trade-in?**
A: Not necessary. We evaluate vehicles in their current condition. However, a well-maintained vehicle may fetch a better value.

### Accessories & Customization

**Q: Can I install third-party accessories?**
A: Yes, but we recommend using AutoDrive-approved accessories to avoid warranty issues. Third-party modifications may void certain warranty coverages.

**Q: Do you offer paint protection?**
A: Yes! We offer ceramic coating and paint protection film (PPF) services. Prices start at $500 for ceramic coating and $1,200 for full-body PPF.

**Q: Can I get custom seat upholstery?**
A: Yes, we work with certified upholstery partners. Custom leather seats start at $800. This is installed post-delivery and doesn't affect your warranty.

### Sample 4: Trade-In Evaluation

**Agent**: Hello! Thank you for calling AutoDrive Motors. This is Maya. How can I help you today?

**Customer**: I want to trade in my old car and buy a new one from you guys.

**Agent**: That's wonderful! I can definitely help you with that. Let me ask a few questions about your current vehicle to give you an estimated trade-in value. What's the make and model?

**Customer**: It's a 2018 Honda Accord.

**Agent**: Great! What's the approximate mileage on it?

**Customer**: About 45,000 miles.

**Agent**: And how's the overall condition - excellent, good, fair, or does it need repairs?

**Customer**: I'd say it's in good condition. Regular maintenance, no major issues.

**Agent**: Perfect! Any accidents or major repairs in its history?

**Customer**: No accidents. Just regular oil changes and one brake pad replacement.

**Agent**: Excellent! Based on a 2018 Honda Accord with 45,000 miles in good condition, the estimated trade-in value is approximately $16,000 to $18,000.

However, for an accurate valuation, I recommend a physical inspection at our dealership. Our team will inspect the exterior, interior, mechanical condition, and service history. The inspection is completely free and takes about 30 minutes.

Plus, great news! We're currently offering an exchange bonus of up to $3,000 on select AutoDrive models when you trade in your vehicle. This is in addition to the trade-in value.

**Customer**: That sounds good! Which AutoDrive model would you recommend?

**Agent**: It depends on what you're looking for! The Honda Accord is a sedan, so you might like:
- **AutoDrive Elegance** - Our premium sedan at $28,500, very similar to the Accord in comfort and features
- **AutoDrive Crown** - Our executive luxury sedan at $35,900 if you want to upgrade

Or if you'd like to switch to an SUV for more space, the **AutoDrive Explorer** at $42,000 is a fantastic family vehicle.

What matters most to you - similar driving experience, luxury upgrade, or more space?

**Customer**: I think I'd like to try an SUV. The Explorer sounds interesting.

**Agent**: Excellent choice! The AutoDrive Explorer is our 7-seater SUV with great features and fuel efficiency. With your trade-in value of around $17,000 and the exchange bonus of $3,000, you'd be looking at about $22,000 towards the Explorer.

Would you like to schedule an inspection for your Honda Accord and maybe a test drive of the Explorer?

**Customer**: Yes, that would be perfect!

**Agent**: Great! When would you like to come in?

**Customer**: How about Saturday morning?

**Agent**: Perfect! Saturday, we have slots at 9 AM, 11 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM. Which works for you?

**Customer**: 11 AM.

**Agent**: Excellent! May I have your name and phone number?

**Customer**: David Park, 602-555-4123.

**Agent**: Thank you, David! You're scheduled for Saturday at 11 AM at our main showroom, 789 Highway Plaza. Please bring:
- Your Honda Accord
- Vehicle registration
- Service records if you have them
- Both sets of keys
- Your driver's license for the test drive

We'll evaluate your Accord and you can test drive the AutoDrive Explorer. The whole process takes about an hour. You'll receive a confirmation text shortly. Anything else I can help with?

**Customer**: No, that's all. Thanks!

**Agent**: You're welcome, David! Looking forward to seeing you on Saturday. Have a great day!
