## After Upload: Website Integration

Once prompts are uploaded and tested on Retell dashboard, then we can:

**Option A: Add Voice to Industries Pages**
- Integrate Retell SDK into HeroSection component
- "Tap to Talk" will actually call agent

**Option B: Redirect to Demo Page**
- "Tap to Talk" redirects to `/demo` with agent selected
- Demo page already has Retell working

**Option C: Add Agent Cards** (Like demo page)
- Show agent cards on industry pages
- Each card has "Talk to Agent" button
