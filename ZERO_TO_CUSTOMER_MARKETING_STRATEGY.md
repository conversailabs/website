## üî• The Truth About Starting

**Week 1**: You'll feel like nobody cares
**Week 2**: You'll get your first "maybe"
**Week 3**: Your first demo no-show
**Week 4**: Your first "YES!"
**Week 8**: Your first referral
**Week 12**: You'll wonder why you didn't start sooner

**Remember**: Every big company started with zero customers. The only difference is they didn't stop at zero.
